Based on the session, the student responds well to:

- **Step-by-Step Breakdown**: Clear, incremental instructions to tackle each part of the problem.
- **Scaffolded Questions**: Guiding the student with questions to lead them toward the correct solution.
- **Simplified Language**: Using easily understandable terms appropriate for a young learner.
- **Concrete Examples**: Using relatable contexts, such as candies or groups, to explain abstract concepts.
- **Repetition**: Reinforcing correct answers by revisiting them.

Future teaching sessions should blend these methods to align with the student's learning style and comprehension.Based on previous teaching sessions and the studentâ€™s positive ratings, the student responds best to:

1. **Step-by-Step Breakdown** (5/5): Clear and incremental instructions to clearly outline the learning process.
2. **Scaffolded Questions** (5/5): Using guiding questions to encourage independent thinking and problem-solving.
3. **Simplified Language** (5/5): Ensuring clarity and understanding with age-appropriate terms.
4. **Concrete Examples** (5/5): Employing relatable contexts, such as candies or groups, to explain abstract concepts.
5. **Repetition** (5/5): Reinforcing learning through repeated practice.

Future sessions should primarily incorporate these methods for optimal understanding and engagement.
